    Who am I?

        As a UX & Visual Designer, 
        I like to be the bridge connecting online products and marketing strategies with design concepts. 
        </h3>

        <p>
        After some years of experience in different performance marketing 
        fields I went back to my creative roots, moving to the creative side 
        of the online world to design visuals done to convert.

        My studies in philosophy helped me to develop the skill of critical thinking and the ability to see things from different points of view, to not be a conformist and try to take the right path to reach a goal.
        It also gave me the curiosity to understand the why’s and how’s of a process. This is the reason I started a Master in Digital Experience Design, to dig into every step of the design, of the perfect customer journey. 
        I know how to start a project, backed with an initial customer research, and look for opportunities to afterwards design a UX/UI solution.

        To switch off from the digital experiences I like to take my analogic 
        cameras for a walk and enjoy the rather slow passing time between a shot and a developed film.
